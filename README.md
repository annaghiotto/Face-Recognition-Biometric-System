# Face Recognition Biometric System
Detailed description of the project and our approach is available in the report file [report.pdf](report.pdf).

The project includes three guides embedded within the code as comments:

[Lab1_Biometric_Systems.ipynb](Lab1_Biometric_Systems.ipynb)

[Lab2_Biometric_Systems.ipynb](Lab2_Biometric_Systems.ipynb)

[Lab3_Biometric_Systems.ipynb](Lab3_Biometric_Systems.ipynb)


`eigenfaces.ipynb` is responsible for computing eigenfaces and creating `encoder.pki` file.

### To run program:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 main.py`
